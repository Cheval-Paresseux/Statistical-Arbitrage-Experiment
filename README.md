# Statistical Arbitrage Experiment

This repository contains various approaches to statistical arbitrage, each organized into separate branches. The goal is to develop and backtest different strategies based on statistical methods and asset price behaviors. Each branch represents a unique approach, with its own set of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for testing and simulation.

## Branches

- **Cointegration Theory**: A strategy based on creating combinations of cointegrated assets and trading the mean-reverting behavior of their price spreads.
- More strategies to come...

## Structure

Each branch contains the following elements:

- **Python Files**: Core functions and classes used for data processing, clustering, combination generation, and signal computation.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application of the strategy on specific datasets, with simulations and results.
- **Data**: Input datasets (usually price histories) used for backtesting.
